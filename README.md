# Simple example of EIP712 authentication inÂ Cairo

## Testing

`testing` folder contains a python script that serves as an Ethereum signing service with a fixed private key that can be changed to any valid Ethereum private key.

## Protostar

For testing Cairo scripts you can use protostar which makes it much easier than doing it manually. For a protostar tutorial, I would recommend [this article](https://blog.swmansion.com/testing-starknet-contracts-made-easy-with-protostar-2ecdad3c9133).
